### Prerequisites

Having good knowledge on HTML, CSS and bootstrap.

### Installing

We used an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to build our webpages. The IDE we will use in this course is webstorm. We will also introduce you, however, to the IDE Atom in this course as Atom is very popular. When we introduce the IDEs later in the course, we will also discuss the differences between Webstorm and Atom and share with you why we chose Webstorm. You are also able to access the code through github.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) allow you to write code more easily

Different IDEs
Webstorm
Atom.io
Sublime
Dreamweaver
Github
Important part of any work environment
We will use it through the command line interface
Description:
Choose one editor and get good at it. You don’t need to have all three of these editors, or even watch all three of the editor videos. Just choose one editor. That’s it. Just one. I use webstorm, and in the next video I will tell you why and show it to you. One thing to know: it takes awhile to get good with an IDE. I recently had the experience of driving my friend’s car. And I couldn’t figure out how to do things. I had to stop and spend time trying to find XM radio again. It’s the same way with an IDE. It takes you awhile to be able to drive it quickly and well.

WebStorm

Getting your webstorm to look like my webstorm
Description:
Webstorm is an IDE created by JetBrains. I chose Webstorm because JetBrains also creates an Intellij, and Android Studio is built on top of Intellij. By knowing Webstorm, it’s easier to understand Android Studio. So if you want to build Android Apps somewhere down the line, then using Webstorm is a good choice. I also find Webstorm to provide all of the functionality that I need.

Description:
Atom.io is the new kid on the block. It is very compelling. It was created by github. The people at github know what they’re doing. It is now also open source, which means many talented people are helping it grow. There are also a lot of packages you can get for it. 

```
Sublime
Sublime was the industry standard in the mid-2000’s
Now sublime is the old-dog on the block
It will still work fine, however, have there are stronger arguments in favor of using atom.io and webstorm
Description:
While this video talks about Sublime as a “has-been,” the people who make Sublime have recently updated the editor making it a viable option today. 

```
Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver was the industry standard for website creation in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s.
Dreamweaver is a WYSIWYG (weeeseeewigggeeee) tool - what you see is what you get
It allows you to drag-and-drap items around and dreamweaver writes the code for you
As dreamweaver writes the code for you, it can be a big crutch that prevents you from writing and learning the code yourself
It is strongly recommended that you do not use dreamweaver
Most professional website builders today do not use dreamweaver.
Description:
I just have to mention Dreamweaver because I don’t want you to fall in its evil embrace. Dreamweaver is like the drug dealer who gives crack cocaine to people, gets them hooked, then sucks all of the money out of them as their lives are destroyed. Dreamweaver will make you feel very good at first, but ultimately it will make you a pathetic and insecure coder who doesn’t understand anything.
